**Smart Contract Security Labs (`sc-security-labs`)** is a curated collection of hands-on projects, challenges, and educational resources focused on **Ethereum, DeFi, and Web3 security**.  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **deep practical expertise in identifying, exploiting, and defending against smart contract vulnerabilities**, while also documenting critical blockchain security concepts in a structured way.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### `concepts/`
Clear and concise explanations of **core blockchain & DeFi concepts**, written with a security-first perspective.  
Covers topics like transaction ordering, composability, liquidation mechanisms, randomness in smart contracts, and more.

### `ethernaut/`
Comprehensive solutions to all [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges:  
- Each level solved with **exploitation scripts, automated tests, and detailed writeups**.  
- Demonstrates practical offensive security techniques and remediation strategies.

### `web3-quiz/`
A knowledge base of **blockchain security FAQs and quizzes**:  
- Covers smart contract internals, EVM quirks, Solidity gotchas, and DeFi-specific risks.  
- Serves as a quick reference for common pitfalls and exam-style questions.

### `tutorials/`
Code-driven tutorials and mini-projects illustrating security concepts in practice.  
Examples include:  
- Implementing bonding curves securely  
- Building upgradeable contracts with safety checks  
- Testing failure modes with fuzzing/invariants

---

## 🛡️ Highlights
- 📖 **Educational + Practical** — combines theory with reproducible exploits and defenses  
- ⚡ **Automation First** — exploits and solutions come with Python/Foundry test harnesses  
- 🔍 **Security Mindset** — focuses on real-world risks, not just academic examples  
- 🧩 **Composability** — each module builds toward a full-stack understanding of Web3 security
