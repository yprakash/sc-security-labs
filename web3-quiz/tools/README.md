# Leveraging Static & Dynamic Analysis for Smart Contract Auditing

**Audience:** Experienced Solidity developers and auditors aiming to combine manual expertise with tool-assisted auditing.

---

## Introduction

Manual code review is irreplaceable. Auditors know that **critical vulnerabilities often hide in complex logic, upgradeable patterns, or economic flows**.

However, **static and dynamic analysis tools** can dramatically improve audit efficiency, catch low-hanging mistakes, and uncover subtle edge cases that manual review alone might miss.

This guide explores how to leverage these tools **strategically**, understand their limits, and integrate them into an **advanced audit workflow**.

## 1. Static Analysis Tools: Patterns, Strengths, and Limitations

Think of static analysis as **X-ray scans of your code**: it inspects structure and patterns **without execution**.
### Key Tools
- **Slither**
  - Detects: reentrancy, uninitialized storage, proxy pattern issues, visibility mistakes.
  - Strength: pattern-based vulnerability detection.
  - Limitation: cannot reason about runtime economic exploits; may produce **false positives**.

- **Mythril**
  - Detects: integer overflows, reentrancy, unchecked sends using symbolic execution.
  - Strength: EVM bytecode-level detection.
  - Limitation: may timeout on complex contracts; false positives/negatives on deep call chains.

- **Solhint / Solium**
  - Detects: style, visibility, and security best practices.
  - Limitation: primarily style-focused; cannot find deep logic bugs.

### Key Concept: Pattern Matching

- Static tools (like above) analyze the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** or EVM bytecode for **known unsafe patterns**.
- Examples:
  - `tx.origin` used for authorization → classic anti-pattern.
  - `call.value()` without reentrancy guard → potential reentrancy.
  - Uninitialized storage variables or unused return values.
- **Limitation:** They **cannot see runtime behavior or logic flows**, so they may flag safe code as unsafe (false positives) or miss economic/external-call vulnerabilities.

### False Positives Explained

Static tools flag patterns without context. Examples:
```solidity
require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
```
- Slither might report potential reentrancy if an external call exists nearby, even if access control prevents exploitation.
- Arithmetic operations may be flagged as overflow risks even when using `SafeMath` or `unchecked` blocks.  
Rule: Treat static analysis as guidance, not verdict.

## 2. Dynamic Analysis Tools: Runtime Insights
Dynamic analysis tools execute contracts in controlled environments to observe behavior during runtime. It is like physically interacting with the vault: you execute the contract and observe outcomes.
### Key Tools
- **Hardhat / Foundry / Truffle Tests**
  - Unit and integration tests.
  - Simulate protocol flows, reentrancy, and upgradeable contract behavior.

- **Echidna / Forge Fuzzing**
  - Property-based fuzz testing.
  - Finds edge cases humans might miss.
  - Limitation: effectiveness depends entirely on well-defined invariants.

- **Tenderly / Ganache / Hardhat forked mainnet**
  - Simulate complex DeFi interactions.
  - Monitor runtime behavior, gas usage, and potential MEV exploitation.

- **MythX**
  - Cloud-based dynamic analysis.
  - Combines static and dynamic techniques for deeper insights.
  - Limitation: may require paid plans for full features.
  - Strength: can analyze complex interactions and economic flows.
  - Detects: reentrancy, gas limit issues, and economic vulnerabilities.

### Key Concept: Runtime Behavior
- Dynamic tools execute contracts, allowing you to observe:
  - **State changes**: how balances, ownership, and other variables evolve.
  - **Gas usage**: potential gas limit issues or inefficiencies.
  - **Economic flows**: how funds move through the contract and interactions with other contracts.
  - **Edge cases**: unexpected behaviors that static analysis might miss.

### Example: Fuzz Testing
Fuzz testing generates random inputs to find unexpected behaviors. For example, it might discover:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
}
```
- A fuzz test might send a large `amount` that exceeds the balance, triggering an unexpected state change or gas limit issue.
- This can reveal vulnerabilities that static analysis would not catch, such as:
  - Incorrect balance updates.
  - Gas limit issues when transferring large amounts.
  - Unexpected interactions with other contracts that lead to reentrancy or other vulnerabilities.

### Limitations of Dynamic Analysis
- **Coverage**: Dynamic tests only cover paths executed during testing. If a path is not tested, it remains unverified.
- **Environment**: Dynamic tools require a controlled environment (like testnets or local forks) to simulate interactions, which may not perfectly replicate mainnet conditions.
- **Complexity**: Complex interactions (e.g., with multiple contracts) can lead to unexpected behaviors that are hard to reproduce in tests.
- **Economic Exploits**: Dynamic tools may not fully capture economic vulnerabilities unless specifically designed to do so (e.g., simulating MEV attacks).
- **False Negatives**: Just because a dynamic test passes does not mean the contract is safe; it only means the tested paths behaved as expected.
- **Resource Intensive**: Dynamic analysis can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and time, especially for complex contracts or large test suites.
- **Dependency on Test Cases**: The effectiveness of dynamic analysis heavily relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the test cases written, on how well invariants and test scenarios are defined. Poorly designed tests can lead to missed vulnerabilities.
- **Tool Limitations**: Some dynamic analysis tools may have limitations in terms of the types of vulnerabilities they can detect or the complexity of contracts they can analyze effectively.
- **Integration Complexity**: Integrating dynamic analysis tools into existing workflows can be complex, especially in large projects with multiple dependencies and environments.
- **False Sense of Security**: Relying solely on dynamic analysis can create a false sense of security, as it may not catch all vulnerabilities, especially those related to economic exploits or complex interactions.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping dynamic analysis tools and test cases up to date with contract changes can be time-consuming and requires ongoing effort.

## 3. Comparing Static vs Dynamic Analysis
| Aspect              | Static Analysis                                         | Dynamic Analysis                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method**          | Code inspection, pattern matching                       | Execute code in a controlled environment                                      |
| **Strengths**       | Quick first-pass detection of common vulnerabilities    | Real behavior observation, tests complex interactions, detects runtime errors |
| **Limitations**     | Misses runtime flows, economic logic; false positives   | Only covers scenarios you test; requires invariant definitions                |
| **False Positives** | Common: pattern may appear unsafe but is logically safe | Rare: failures are real execution results                                     |
| **Best Use**        | First-pass scanning to highlight obvious flaws          | Confirm flows, test invariants, stress edge cases                             |

**Insight**: Static analysis is breadth-focused, dynamic analysis is depth-focused. Combining both maximizes audit effectiveness.

## 4. Integrated Advanced Audit Workflow
- **Initial scan**: Run static tools (Slither / Solhint) to catch obvious coding errors.
- **Dynamic tests**: Execute Hardhat/Foundry tests for core flows.
- **Fuzzing & invariants**: Use Echidna or Forge to probe edge cases.
- **Manual review**: Focus on cross-contract interactions, upgradeable storage, economic logic, MEV vectors.
- **Iterate**: Use tool reports to guide deeper manual inspection.

> Conceptual principle: Each layer reduces uncertainty, but **critical reasoning remains the auditor's strongest weapon**.
