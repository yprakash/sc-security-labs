## üîé What is a Beacon Proxy?
- A Beacon Proxy is a type of upgradeable proxy (OpenZeppelin‚Äôs `UpgradeableBeacon` + `BeaconProxy` system).
- Instead of storing the implementation address in the proxy, the proxy asks a **Beacon contract** for the current implementation.
- The Beacon itself can be upgraded (changing the implementation address for all proxies pointing to it).

So you have 3 actors:
- BeaconProxy (user-facing contract, forwards calls).
- Beacon (stores implementation address).
- Implementation contract(s) (the actual logic).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Beacon Proxy Risks
1. Shared Risk Across Many Proxies
   - If the beacon is upgraded to a malicious implementation, **all proxies depending on it are instantly compromised**.
   - This is much riskier than a single `TransparentProxy`, since one mistake affects N proxies.
2. Beacon Upgrade Authority Centralization
   - The Beacon has an `upgradeTo` function, usually callable only by the `owner`.
   - If the owner‚Äôs private key is compromised, _every proxy_ is at risk.
   - In audits, this is a **centralization risk** red flag. Strong controls (multisig, timelocks, governance) are expected.
3. Initialization Issues Multiply
   - Every proxy that delegates to the beacon implementation **shares the same logic** but has separate storage.
   - If initializers aren‚Äôt properly guarded, one proxy‚Äôs initializer misuse could be replicated across all deployments.
4. Implementation Slot vs. Beacon Slot Collision
   - In EIP-1967 proxies, the implementation is stored in a special slot (`0x3608...`).
   - For Beacons, you now also have a **beacon slot** (`0xa3f0...`).
   - Misusing these (e.g., writing to `implementation` directly instead of beacon slot) can brick the proxy.
5. Beacon Logic Contract Must Itself Be Correct
   - The `UpgradeableBeacon` contract is very simple but if replaced by a custom one, storage layout and upgrade logic bugs can cascade.
   - Auditors always check that the Beacon contract can only store a valid implementation (e.g., must be a contract, not EOA).
6. Ecosystem-Level Risk
   - In practice, some protocols deploy **hundreds of Beacon Proxies** pointing to a single beacon.
   - Any malicious upgrade ‚Üí systemic failure, all assets drained in one transaction.

### ‚úÖ Audit Checklist for Beacon Proxies
- Does `UpgradeableBeacon` enforce `Address.isContract(newImplementation)`?
- Who controls `upgradeTo` on the Beacon? Is it multisig/timelocked?
- Are initializers in implementations `initializer`-guarded?
- Are storage collisions avoided between beacon and proxies?
- Is the upgrade flow tested (proxy keeps its state after upgrade)?
- Is there an emergency stop/freeze mechanism on upgrades?

#### Deeper Beacon-specific audit risks beyond that centralization/systemic issue are:
1. Beacon Slot Collision Risk
   - Proxies store their beacon address at the **EIP-1967 beacon slot** (`0xa3f0...`).
   - If an implementation contract accidentally uses this slot (via bad storage layout or inline assembly), the proxy can be bricked.
2. Beacon Contract Tampering
   - If someone upgrades the _Beacon itself_ (not just the implementation), they can point all proxies to a fake beacon, which then points to malicious code.
   - Auditors must confirm the Beacon contract is immutable after deployment, except for controlled `upgradeTo`.
3. Initialization Gotchas
   - Each proxy has independent storage.
   - If an implementation has an unguarded initializer, every proxy can potentially be initialized differently ‚Äî leading to chaos.
4. Unexpected Beacon Reuse
   - Sometimes protocols unintentionally reuse the same Beacon for contracts that were supposed to be independent. This creates correlated risk between unrelated modules.
