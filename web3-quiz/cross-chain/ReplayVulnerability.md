# Cross-Chain Replay Vulnerability
### Definition
A cross-chain replay vulnerability occurs when a transaction signed for one blockchain can be validly
replayed on another chain that shares the same transaction format, signature scheme, and account structure.
This often arises in forks (e.g., Ethereum and Ethereum Classic) or in multi-chain deployments (L1 + L2, or EVM-compatible chains like BSC, Polygon, Avalanche).  
- When blockchains share cryptographic primitives (ECDSA signatures) and transaction serialization, an attacker may take a legitimate transaction from Chain A and “replay” it on Chain B.
- For example: if Alice sends 10 ETH on Ethereum, and that transaction is validly constructed, the same signed transaction could also be valid on Ethereum Classic. Result: Alice unintentionally loses 10 ETC as well.

### Exploit Angle
- Replay attacks exploit lack of chain-specific identifiers in transactions.
- In forks, attackers often scan mempools to find valuable transactions to replay.
- In multi-chain dApps, replay issues occur if contracts or bridges do not separate chain contexts.

### Defenses
1. Chain ID separation: Since EIP-155, Ethereum transactions include `chainId`, which ensures a transaction signed on one chain is invalid on another.
2. Nonce and domain separation: For off-chain signatures (EIP-712 typed data), always include `chainId` and `verifyingContract` in the signed domain.
3. Bridges and cross-chain apps: Must verify chain origin when accepting proofs or signatures.
